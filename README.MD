A digital signature macro for [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)

## Description
Allows confluence users to write contracts in a confluence macro which can be signed directly by logged-in users.
- content and signatures can not be modified once signed
- white list users who can sign
- report when and by whom the contract was signed
- easily send email to signers of the contract
- receive notifications, when your contract was signed

## ClassCastException issue
